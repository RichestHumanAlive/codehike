```js index.js
const https = require("https");

const data = JSON.stringify({
  name: "John Doe",
  email: "johndoe@example.com",
});

const options = {
  hostname: "api.example.com",
  port: 443,
  path: "/users",
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Content-Length": data.length,
  },
};

const req = https.request(options, (res) => {
  console.log(`statusCode: ${res.statusCode}`);

  res.on("data", (d) => {
    process.stdout.write(d);
  });
});

req.on("error", (error) => {
  console.error(error);
});

req.write(data);
req.end();
```

This is an example of how to make a POST request in Node.js using the built-in `https` module. 

You can customize the request by changing the `options` object, which includes the hostname, port, path, method, and headers.

Is this helpful?

# grow-textarea

    </div>
    <div class="textarea-container">
      <textarea class="textarea" placeholder="Type something..."></textarea>
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
```

```css style.css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  min-height: 100vh;
}

.content {
  flex: 1;
  padding: 1rem;
}

.textarea-container {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 0;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  padding: 1rem;
  background-color: #f2f2f2;
}

.textarea {
  width: 100%;
  height: 2rem;
  resize: none;
  overflow: hidden;
  font-size: 1rem;
  line-height: 1.5;
  border: none;
  outline: none;
}

.textarea::placeholder {
  color: #aaa;
}

.textarea:focus {
  height: calc(1.5em + 1rem);
  max-height: calc(1.5em + 1rem + 1.5em * 8);
  overflow-y: auto;
}
```

Here's an example of a fixed textarea that grows as the user types more lines, with a maximum of 10 lines. The `textarea` element is inside a container that is fixed to the bottom of the page. The `textarea` has a fixed height of `2rem` and `overflow: hidden` to hide any overflow. When the `textarea` is focused, its height is set to `calc(1.5em + 1rem)` to show one line of text and some padding. The `max-height` property is set to `calc(1.5em + 1rem + 1.5em * 8)` to allow for a maximum of 10 lines of text. If the user types more than 10 lines, the `textarea` will become scrollable.

Is this what you were looking for?

- Yes, thank you!
- Can you explain the `calc()` function?
- How can I change the maximum number of lines?


# fix-regex

```js index.js
const sectionRegex = /(^#+ .+)([\s\S]+?)(?=^#+ .+|\n\n|$)/gm;
const sections = [];
let match;
while ((match = sectionRegex.exec(promptMarkdown)) !== null) {
  const role = match[1];
  const content = match[2];
  sections.push({ role, content });
}
console.log(sections);
```

I added an extra `$` to the positive lookahead in the regex to include the end of the string as a possible match. This should allow the code to correctly capture the last section of the markdown.

Does this solve your issue?

- Yes, thank you!
- Can you explain what the regex is doing?

# first-day-pandas

```python script.py
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({
    'date': ['2022-01-01', '2022-02-15', '2022-03-31']
})

# focus
df['first_day_of_month'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date']).dt.to_period('M').dt.to_timestamp()

print(df)
```

Here's an example of how to extract the first day of the month from a `datetime` column in a Pandas DataFrame.

First, we convert the `date` column to a `datetime` type using the `pd.to_datetime()` method. Then, we use the `dt.to_period()` method to convert the `datetime` values to `Period` objects with a monthly frequency. Finally, we use the `dt.to_timestamp()` method to convert the `Period` objects to `Timestamp` objects representing the first day of each month.

This will create a new column in the DataFrame called `first_day_of_month` with the first day of the month for each date in the `date` column.

Does this solve your problem?

---

- Yes, that works for me
- Can I extract the last day of the month instead?
- What if the date column is not in the yyyy-mm-dd format?


# swift-assign-self

```swift main.swift
struct Person {
  var name: String
  
  mutating func changeName(to newName: String) {
    self = Person(name: newName)
  }
}

var person = Person(name: "John")
person.changeName(to: "Jane")
print(person.name)
```

The `self` keyword in Swift refers to the current instance of a struct or class. In the example above, we have a `Person` struct with a `changeName(to:)` method that takes a new name and assigns a new `Person` instance with that name to `self`.

The rationale behind this feature is to allow for more flexible and expressive code. By allowing a struct to assign a new value to itself, you can create more complex algorithms that modify the state of the struct in a more concise and readable way.

Does this answer your question?

---

- Yes, thank you
- Can you give me an example of when this feature might be useful?
- Does this feature work the same way for classes?


# c-same-function

```c main.c
#include <stdio.h>

void myFunction();
void myFunction(int x);

int main() {
  myFunction();

  return 0;
}

void myFunction() {
  printf("Hello from myFunction without parameters!\n");
}

void myFunction(int x) {
  printf("Hello from myFunction with parameter %d!\n", x);
}

```

In C, it is possible to declare multiple functions with the same name, as long as they have different parameter lists. This is called function overloading.

In the example above, we have two functions named `myFunction`, one without parameters and one with an integer parameter. When we call `myFunction` without arguments, the first function is called, and when we call it with an integer argument, the second function is called.

Is this what you were looking for?

---

- Yes, thank you!
- Can you show me an example with a different return type?
- Is function overloading available in other programming languages?

const BouncingDots = () => {
  return (
    <div className="bouncing-dots">
      <div className="dot dot-1"></div>
      <div className="dot dot-2"></div>
      <div className="dot dot-3"></div>

export default BouncingDots;

```css BouncingDots.css
.bouncing-dots {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

.dot {
  width: 10px;
  height: 10px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  background-color: #000;
  margin: 0 5px;
  animation: bounce 0.5s infinite alternate;
}

.dot-1 {
  animation-delay: 0.1s;
}

.dot-2 {
  animation-delay: 0.2s;
}

.dot-3 {
  animation-delay: 0.3s;
}

@keyframes bounce {
  to {
    transform: translateY(-10px);
  }
}
```

Here's an example of a React component that displays three dots bouncing with a little delay between each other. The dots are created using three `div` elements with a class of `dot`. Each dot has a different `animation-delay` value to create the desired effect.

You can adjust the `animation` property to change the speed and timing of the animation.

I've also included some basic CSS to center the dots and style them.

Is this helpful?

- Yes, thank you!
- Can you explain how to use this component in a React app?
- How can I change the color of the dots?
