```js index.js
const https = require("https");

const data = JSON.stringify({
  name: "John Doe",
  email: "johndoe@example.com",
});

const options = {
  hostname: "api.example.com",
  port: 443,
  path: "/users",
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Content-Length": data.length,
  },
};

const req = https.request(options, (res) => {
  console.log(`statusCode: ${res.statusCode}`);

  res.on("data", (d) => {
    process.stdout.write(d);
  });
});

req.on("error", (error) => {
  console.error(error);
});

req.write(data);
req.end();
```

This is an example of how to make a POST request in Node.js using the built-in `https` module. 

You can customize the request by changing the `options` object, which includes the hostname, port, path, method, and headers.

The `data` variable contains the data you want to send in the request, which in this case is a JSON object.

Is this helpful?

- Yes, thank you!
- Can you show me an example with the `axios` library?

# grow-textarea

```html index.html
<div class="container">
  <div class="textarea-container">
    <textarea class="textarea" placeholder="Type something..."></textarea>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css style.css
.container {
  height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.textarea-container {
  flex: 1;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: flex-end;
  align-items: flex-end;
  padding: 10px;
}

.textarea {
  width: 100%;
  max-height: calc(1.2em * 10);
  resize: none;
  overflow-y: auto;
  padding: 10px;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 5px;
  box-shadow: 0 0 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
}
```

This code creates a container that takes up the full height of the viewport and contains a textarea that is fixed to the bottom of the container. The textarea has a maximum height of 10 lines and will scroll if the user types more than 10 lines.

Is this what you were looking for?

- Yes, thank you!
- Can you explain how the `max-height` property works?
- How can I change the number of maximum lines?


# fix-regex

```js index.js
const sectionRegex = /(^#+ .+)([\s\S]+?)(?=^#+ .+|\n\n|$)/gm;
const sections = [];
let match;
while ((match = sectionRegex.exec(promptMarkdown)) !== null) {
  const role = match[1];
  const content = match[2];
  sections.push({ role, content });
}
console.log(sections);
```

I added the `$` character to the positive lookahead in the regular expression to also match the end of the string. This will ensure that the last section is included in the `sections` array.

Does this solve your issue?

---

- Yes, thank you!
- What if there are no empty lines between the last section and the end of the string?
- Can you explain how this regex works?


# first-day-pandas

```python script.py
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
df["date_column"] = pd.to_datetime(df["date_column"])

df["first_day_of_month"] = df["date_column"].dt.to_period("M").dt.start_time

print(df.head())
```

In this example, I'm assuming you have a pandas DataFrame with a column named `date_column` that contains datetime values. 

First, I convert the column to a datetime type using the `pd.to_datetime()` method. 

Then, I create a new column named `first_day_of_month` by using the `dt.to_period()` method to convert the datetime values to monthly periods, and then using the `dt.start_time` attribute to extract the first day of each period.

Is this helpful?

- Yes, thank you!
- What if I want to extract the last day of the month instead?
- Can you show me an example with a datetime string format?


# swift-assign-self

cost: 0.0013
finish_reason: stop

```swift main.swift
struct Person {
  var name: String
  
  mutating func changeName(to newName: String) {
    self = Person(name: newName)
  }
}

var person = Person(name: "John")
person.changeName(to: "Jane")
print(person.name)
```

The `self` keyword in Swift refers to the current instance of a struct or class. In the example above, the `changeName(to:)` method is defined as `mutating`, which means it can modify the properties of the struct.

By assigning a new value to `self`, we are effectively creating a new instance of the struct with the updated property value. This is a convenient way to modify the state of a struct without having to manually update each property.

As for the rationale behind this feature, it allows for more concise and expressive code when working with structs in Swift.

Does this answer your question?

---

- Yes, thank you
- Can you show me an example with a class instead of a struct?
- Is there any performance impact to using `self` in this way?


# c-same-function

```c main.c
#include <stdio.h>

void myFunction();
void myFunction(int x);

int main() {
  myFunction();
  myFunction(42);
  return 0;
}

void myFunction() {
  printf("Hello, world!\n");
}

void myFunction(int x) {
  printf("The answer is %d\n", x);
}
```

In C, you can declare multiple functions with the same name as long as they have different parameter lists. This is called function overloading.

In the example above, `myFunction()` is declared twice: once without parameters and once with an `int` parameter. When you call `myFunction()` without arguments, the first version of the function is called. When you call `myFunction(42)`, the second version of the function is called.

Is this what you were looking for?

---

- Yes, thank you!
- Can you show me an example with a return value?
- Is function overloading available in all programming languages?

# react-three-dots

```jsx BouncingDots.js
import React from "react";
import "./BouncingDots.css";

const BouncingDots = () => {
  return (
    <div className="bouncing-dots">
      <div className="dot dot-1"></div>
      <div className="dot dot-2"></div>
      <div className="dot dot-3"></div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default BouncingDots;
```

```css BouncingDots.css
.bouncing-dots {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

.dot {
  width: 10px;
  height: 10px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  background-color: #000;
  margin: 0 5px;
  animation: bounce 0.5s ease-in-out infinite;
}

.dot-1 {
  animation-delay: -0.1s;
}

.dot-2 {
  animation-delay: -0.2s;
}

.dot-3 {
  animation-delay: -0.3s;
}

@keyframes bounce {
  0% {
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
  50% {
    transform: translateY(-10px);
  }
  100% {
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
}
```

Here's a simple React component that displays three dots bouncing with a little delay between each other. The dots are created using three `div` elements with a class of `dot`. The animation is achieved using CSS keyframes and the `animation` property.

You can adjust the animation duration and delay by modifying the values in the CSS file.

Is this helpful?

- Yes, thank you!
- Can you explain how the `animation-delay` property works?
- How can I change the color of the dots?
