{a list with three text-only potential answers by me}

# user

My issue/question:
"""
stop a fetch in JS
"""

# assistant

```js index.js
fetch("https://api.example.com/data")
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```

I'm assuming you're currently using the Fetch API to make a request.

Is this accurate?

- Yes, continue
- No, I'm using async/await
- No, I'm using XMLHttpRequest
