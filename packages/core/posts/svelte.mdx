Welcome to the Svelte tutorial! This will teach you everything you need to know to easily build web applications of all sizes, with high performance and a small footprint.

You can also consult the [API docs](https://svelte.dev/docs) and the [examples](https://svelte.dev/examples), or — if you're impatient to start hacking on your machine locally — create a project with `npm init svelte`.

## What is Svelte?

Svelte is a tool for building web applications. Like other user interface frameworks, it allows you to build your app _declaratively_ out of components that combine markup, styles and behaviours.

These components are _compiled_ into small, efficient JavaScript modules that eliminate overhead traditionally associated with UI frameworks.

You can build your entire app with Svelte (for example, using an application framework like [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), which this tutorial will cover), or you can add it incrementally to an existing codebase. You can also ship components as standalone packages that work anywhere.

## How to use this tutorial

> You'll need to have basic familiarity with HTML, CSS and JavaScript to understand Svelte.

This tutorial is split into four main parts:

- [Basic Svelte](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/welcome-to-svelte) (you are here)
- [Advanced Svelte](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/tweens)
- [Basic SvelteKit](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/introducing-sveltekit)
- [Advanced SvelteKit](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/optional-params)

Each section will present an exercise designed to illustrate a feature. Later exercises build on the knowledge gained in earlier ones, so it's recommended that you go from start to finish. If necessary, you can navigate via the menu above.

```svelte src/App.svelte
<h1>Welcome!</h1>
```

If you get stuck, you can click the `solve` button to the left of the editorin the top right of the editor view. (Use the toggle below to switch between tutorial and editor views. The `solve` button is disabled on sections like this one that don't include an exercise.) Try not to rely on it too much; you will learn faster by figuring out where to put each suggested code block and manually typing it in to the editor.

## Part 1 / Introduction / Your first component

In Svelte, an application is composed from one or more _components_. A component is a reusable self-contained block of code that encapsulates HTML, CSS and JavaScript that belong together, written into a `.svelte` file. The `App.svelte` file, open in the code editor to the right, is a simple component.

## Adding data

A component that just renders some static markup isn't very interesting. Let's add some data.

First, add a script tag to your component and declare a `name` variable:

```svelte App.svelte
<script>
	let name = 'Svelte';
</script>

<h1>Hello world!</h1>
```

Then, we can refer to `name` in the markup:

```svelte App.svelte
<h1>Hello {name}!</h1>
```

Inside the curly braces, we can put any JavaScript we want. Try changing `name` to `name.toUpperCase()` for a shoutier greeting.

```svelte App.svelte
<h1>Hello {name.toUpperCase()}!</h1>
```

</Hike>
